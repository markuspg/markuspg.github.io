  <div class="post-content"><p>Unfortunately my <em>InfinityBook Pro 15 v4</em> from <a href="https://www.tuxedocomputers.com">TUXEDO Computers GmbH</a> recently got dropped badly twice. After the second drop the screen was flickering at best or not working at all. This made me attempt to disassemble it to try to fix the screen. The barebone is a <em>N15xZU</em> from <em>Clevo</em>. The sticker on the underside can be seen below:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/n15xzu_repair/01_underside.jpg" alt="Underside sticker"  />
</p>
<p>At first I loosened all screws on the underside. The red and the yellow one are particularly important, since these are required to lift the keyboard in the next step. Through the hole of the yellow screw the keyboard can be lifted slightly by pressing it with a thin stick.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/n15xzu_repair/02_underside_screws.jpg" alt="Underside screws"  />
</p>
<p>Lifting the keyboard by pressing it from below allowed to go under it in its edges and then slowly unclip it all around. Special care has to be taken not to pluck out its cables forcefully! The brackets of the cables&rsquo; sockets are to be carefully folded upwards. Mistakenly I thought they were to be pulled off in direction of the cables, but this broke the brackets off. Still the cables hold reasonably well, but it&rsquo;s better to avoid that.</p>
