  "articleBody": "Currently I work on porting GnoTime from deprecated dependencies on Gnome 2 into the modern era. The last “feature commit” before the refactoring was in 2013 - so the dependencies are quite ancient. Likewise the build system is good old GNU Autotools. So apart of upgrading the dependencies porting the build to a more modern build system would be a worthwhile effort. For my own projects I try to keep the dependencies compatible to current Debian oldstable, but during refactoring I prefer to use the most recent tooling available.\nOne major challenge in this process is that the code does not build on up-to-date Linux distributions. Out of the box it compiled only on Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin) and with a minor (linkage) fix on Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty Tahr) too. So the question was if CMake and Meson could be made working on these ancient distributions. I cloned their repositories and set off to try it out.\nCurrent Meson 1.1.0 requires at least Python 3.8 and Ninja 1.8.2 or newer. Amazingly it was possible to compile and install current Python 3.11.3 and Ninja 1.11.1 without issues on Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty Tahr). With these it was possible to build GnoTime with Meson without issues (the Meson branch is not upstreamed to GnoTime yet).\nFor convenient integration with modern IDEs a CMake file has been added to the GnoTime project already. CMake is not intended as the future build system though, since Meson seems to be more prevalent in the ecosystem of Gnome. CMake 3.26.3 could be built and installed on Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty Tahr) without issues too. Both CMake and Meson succeeded to compile a working binary of GnoTime in their current versions! So both can be executed in their current releases on a nearly ten year old system (although Meson unfairly profits from the superb dependency handling of Python)!!\nA different level will be Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin). Will both work there too? Python 3.11.1 fails to compile due to -std=c11 being an unknown command line option for ccon Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin). Trying the 3.10 branch with 3.10.11 was successful. This is still very impressive since Python 3.10.0 was released in October of 2021, so more than nice years after Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin) got released! Ninja 1.11.1 built without issues on Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin) - so big respect to its developers too! The last tool missing is CMake. All recent CMake versions fail to build, due to insufficient support of modern C++ in Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin). The most recent buildable version of CMake is 3.9.6. On Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin) again both CMake (3.9.6) and Meson (1.1.0) succeeded to build GnoTime. Meson produces a working binary, while CMake fails during linking.\nWhat’s the bottom line? In my early C++ days I tried every new latest and greatest feature. Now after a few years of programming in a professional context and dealing with all kinds of legacy code and toolchains I came to cherish a more conservative approach. It’s more friendly to users who are bound to older hardware and toolchains and like in the case of trying to move GnoTime to a more recent build system while trying not to break compatibility with well seasoned Ubuntu releases, it really is a game changer.\nSo thanks and respect again to the devs of Python and Ninja!\n",
