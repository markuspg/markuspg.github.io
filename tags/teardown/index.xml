      <description>Unfortunately my InfinityBook Pro 15 v4 from TUXEDO Computers GmbH recently got dropped badly twice. After the second drop the screen was flickering at best or not working at all.

At first I loosened all screws on the underside. The red and the yellow one are particularly important, since these are required to lift the keyboard in the next step.</description>
