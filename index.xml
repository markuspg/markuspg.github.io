      <description>For a current work project I&amp;rsquo;m again dealing with building and modifying the Android Open Source Project. As usual my operating system of choice for that task is Debian Stretch (9.12).
Since my last Android builds Google&amp;rsquo;s repo tool for organizing the multitude of repositories that are needed for an Android build got finally updated from Python 2 to Python 3 (and that seemingly straight to Python 3.6).
Therefore on every invocation of repo init I got a complaint about an incompatible Python version being used (it still worked, but who does not like resolving error messages?</description>

      <title>Quick AOSP Build</title>

      <description>This is an attempt at trying out how fast AOSP can be built for a Nexus 5X from scratch including setting up a virtual machine with Debian Stretch in which the build will be done. For virtualization VMware Workstation 15 Player was used on a Windows 10 v1809 running on a DELL laptop with an Intel Core i9-8950HK and 32 GB RAM (eight virtual cores and 16 GB of RAM were allocated to the VM).</description>

      <title>(Re-)Installing a HP LaserJet P1606dn</title>

      <description>As about every two years I upgraded my mother&amp;rsquo;s computer to the newest Debian release. This time from Stretch to Buster (thanks to the Debian community for this great release again!).
For years I bought HP printers because they worked really nice with Linux. Last I bought a HP LaserJet P1606dn. This one harmed the Linux happiness. It needs some binary plugin and this regularly is a pain to install.</description>

      <title>Wrapping a C&#43;&#43; SDK with C&#43;&#43;/CLI</title>
      <link>https://markuspg.github.io/posts/cppcli/</link>

      <description>Recently at work I had to wrap a C++ SDK for usage in C#. My first try was using P/Invoke which seems to be the more portable way but soon this approach prove to be far too limited (through having to rely only on C linkage). Therefore my coworkers and me decided to utilize C++/CLI for which an introduction can be found here.
One basic problem is how to embed the unmanaged C++ classes from the SDK in managed C++/CLI ones.</description>
